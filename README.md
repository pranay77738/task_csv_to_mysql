######To run the mysql dump file

#open MySQL workbench and import the dump database by browsing from your local machine from server and just hit start, It will creates the database 

# If have more time

#If I have more time, I would like to work with python pandas library to write the code less complex and much easy to read and maintain. By reading the csv file using the pandas makes much easier way to deal with large amount of data and inserting it into database.
